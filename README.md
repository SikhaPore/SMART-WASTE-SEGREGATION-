# SMART-WASTE-SEGREGATION-
This project successfully developed a functional prototype that automates waste segregation. It integrates multiple sensors and actuators to identify, classify and sort different types of waste efficiently. The system significantly reduces manual labor and improves the overall cleanliness and safety of waste handling.
